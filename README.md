# SimpleNukeBot
"copycat" of BetterAntiSpam's nuke command. You can use this bot to !nuke a channel, that's it.

## Notes:
1. This uses Python3 and [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).
2. This isn't flawless compared to BetterAntiSpam, nor it has scheduled nukes.
3. This uses :ok_hand: instead of the blob emoji. You can download the blob emoji here: https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/475070884927897610.png.
